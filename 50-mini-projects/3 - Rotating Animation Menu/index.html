            <p> It's ends here. No guns, no killing. It was a dog. It was a big dog. Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.
                I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.
            </p>

                It's ends here. I'm not wearing hockey pads. Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple
                and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended.

            <p>
                Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages. Swear to me! Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing
                something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the
                world hadn't ended.

                I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham. It's ends here. It's not who I am
                underneath but what I do that defines me. Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new
                rules about the pool area.

            I'm not wearing hockey pads. Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the
            pool area. I'm not wearing hockey pads. Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages.

            The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature
            of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But
            I never became one of them.

            I'm Batman No guns, no killing. I'm Batman I'm not wearing hockey pads. Swear to me! I seek the means to
            fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.

            Swear to me! Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. I seek the means to fight
            injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.
